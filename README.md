Agenda
● Understand participants' understanding about the requirement.
● Explain understanding and fill in the gaps in the requirement and the
understanding.
● Discuss the roadmap to the solution
● Q & A
Roadmap
● Two core models
○ User
○ Event
● Choice of database - mysql/mongodb. Go with mongodb.
● Model schemas - open ended from the client side. Probable schema from our
end
○ User
■ Title
● Metadata, - { required, enum [Mr, Miss, Mrs]}
■ name/fullname
■ Email
● Metadata - { required, unique, valid email syntax}
■ Password
● Metadata - { required, use bcrypt }
■ createdAt
■ modifiedAt
■ resetPasswordToken
○ Event
■ name -> title
■ description
■ eventDate
■ createdBy -> userId
■ invitees [{invitee, invitedAt}]
● Data type - array of objects
● Object structure would be { invitee: ObjectId(userId),
invitedAt: timestamp }
■ createdAt
■ modifiedAt
○ Reset password requests (optional and advanced)
■ userid
■ Email
■ Token
■ createdAt
■ modifiedAt
● API Strategy
○ User
■ User registration
■ User login
■ User logout (destroy JWT token)
■ Change password - authenticated user
■ Reset password (token)
■ Update password (set new password for the user)
○ Event (Protected)
■ Create event
■ Invite to event
■ List events (pagination, filter - date, search, sorting)
■ Update event (only the creator could update it)
■ Event detail
● Middleware Strategy based on JWT strategy
○ Authentication
○ Authorization
● Email (optional and advanced)
○ Nodemailer
○ Use a gmail test account for SMTP settings.
Approach
● Keep the solution clean, simple and error free.
● Keep the solution under source control - Git, GitHub
○ Make commits at logical intervals.
○ Keep commit messages relatable and descriptive.
